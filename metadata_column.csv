taxon_confidence,Taxon Confidence Rating,rating,"Confidence in the ability of the survey team to correctly identify the taxon to the specified level, based solely on identification skill (e.g., not likelihood of a taxon being caught at that station on a location-by-location basis). Quality codes follow: **'High'**: High confidence and consistency. Taxonomy is stable and reliable at this level, and field identification characteristics are well known and reliable. **'Moderate'**: Moderate confidence. Taxonomy may be questionable at this level, or field identification characteristics may be variable and difficult to assess consistently. **'Low'**: Low confidence. Taxonomy is incompletely known, or reliable field identification characteristics are unknown.
