"21","LOAD_USER_DATA_TABLES","A  global temporary table that is employed in the automated process of moving raw survey cruise data from individual Oracle user tables, into a set of centralized ""LOAD"" data tables, owned by schema RACE_DATA. This table is used by an Oracle data form. It is populated by Oracle package procedure RACEBASE_DEV.RACE_USER_EDIT_UTILS.POPULATE_USER_LOAD_LIST(). This table is populated with a list of the candidate ""source"" data tables found on the individual Oracle user account. A candidate table is one for which a recognized data type suffix is part of the table name, and for which a corresponding ""load template"", associated with the recognized data type suffix, can be found that exactly matches the table structure. Once this list is built (represented by records in this table), the Oracle form can query this table for the user, and the user can update the records in this table to verify which data tables are to be selected for the actual migration/load process.","RACE_DATA"
